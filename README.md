# Inspiration :cloud:
Ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene, conversations have revolved around the idea that AI could eventually replace various professions. However, one crucial point often overlooked is that AI still lacks the holistic intelligence and grounded understanding that humans bring to the table. While models like GPT might excel at tasks such as performing well on standardized tests like the MCAT, these tests only measure a fraction of human intelligence and reasoning capabilities. This disconnect underscored the need for tools that don’t just generate responses but truly bridge the gap between AI’s raw computational power and the depth of human understanding.

As model parameters skyrocket exponentially, we’ve noticed that quality improvements are only marginal—sometimes as little as a 2% increase in performance. This diminishing return made us realize that throwing more parameters at a problem isn’t the solution. Instead, we need systems that can explain their reasoning, align more closely with human thought processes, and offer ethical transparency. Whitebox was born from this insight: an AI that’s not just smarter, but more explainable, responsible, and ultimately more useful in the real world.

# What is WhiteBox? :mag:

Whitebox bridges the gap between AI and human reasoning by transforming credible texts, such as medical textbooks, into structured graphs. This transformation not only enhances the AI’s ability to understand and reason through complex material but also provides a level of explainability that traditional AI models often lack. By breaking the content down into interconnected nodes, Whitebox enables users to trace the AI’s thought process step by step, unlocking ethical applications in fields where transparency is critical.

In high-stakes environments like healthcare, law, and finance, the black-box nature of traditional AI models creates trust and ethical barriers. Whitebox addresses this by making the AI’s decision-making process fully visible and understandable, allowing users to see exactly how conclusions were reached. This transparency ensures that the AI can be confidently applied to areas where explainability and ethics are non-negotiable. By making information more accessible, actionable, and ethical, Whitebox is unlocking AI’s potential to transform industries that demand responsible, transparent technology.
